;
;   Cooperative task manager.  The exported resources are:
;
;     TASK_INIT
;
;       Initializes the state.  Must be first call into this module.
;
;     TASK_NEW
;
;       Create a new task.  Call parameters:
;
;         W13  -  Size of the new task stack in bytes, must be even.
;
;         W14  -  Start address of the task for the new stack.
;
;       The new task starts immediately after CALL TASK_NEW instructions.  It
;       is intended that a GOTO be put there.  The call returns 2 instruction
;       words after the call, skipping over the GOTO intended to be immediately
;       after the call.
;
;       Example call:
;
;         mov    #<stack size>, w13
;         move   #<stack>, w14
;         call   task_new
;         goto   <new task start point>
;
;     TASK_YIELD
;
;       Gives all other tasks a chance to run.  Registers listed in TSKSAVE are
;       preserved.
;
;     TASK_YIELD_SAVE
;
;       Like TASK_YIELD, except that all registers are preserved.
;
;     TASK_EXIT
;
;       Entry point to end the current task.  The task state slot becomes
;       unused, and may be re-used by a future call to TASK_NEW.  This entry
;       point can be CALLed, but will not return.  The stack state is
;       irrelevant on entry to TASK_EXIT.  The processor is reset on attempt
;       to exit the only task.
;
;     TASK_KILL
;
;       Kill the task with the ID in W0.  Nothing is done is the ID matches no
;       task.  If the current task is killed, this routine will not return.  The
;       processor is reset on attempt to kill the only task.
;
;
;   The tasks are:
;
;     0  -  Original task.  This runs the main event loop after initialization.
